      <h3>Obfuscation</h3>
      <small>
        In theory it is possible to derive insights into your interests by tracing your inquiry subscription downloads to your IP address.
        To add a layer of obfuscation, I can randomly download more subscriptions than those that you want, but don't run them on your data.

      <h3>Hooks</h3>
      <small>
        Add hooks for various patterns and conditions when data is added or retrieved.
        Integrate them with other apps or services.
