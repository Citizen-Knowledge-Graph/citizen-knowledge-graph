      There are two types of scenarios you can run:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong style="margin: 0; color: navajowhite">"What if"</strong> scenarios: change some
          data points to see how results of inquiries might change or what is then missing to fill
          something out.
          <br>
          <strong style="margin: 0">Note:</strong> Inquiry patterns can be defined to get activated
          specifically for changing a data point from one value to another. This is useful to get
          more information when running scenarios or to get timely change-related information when
          something has actually changed.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong style="margin: 0; color: navajowhite">"How to get there"</strong> scenarios: pick
          scenarios or describe a status you want to reach and see which data point would need to
          change in order to reach this goal.
        </li>
      </ul>
      &#128279; You can connect your graph to someone else's graph, your partners graph for
      instance. Then you can run
      <span style="margin: 0; text-decoration: underline">federated inquiries</span> together.
      <br><br><br>
      &#127775; Your scenario of changing your <span class="datapoint">marital status</span>
      from <span class="datapoint">married</span> to <span class="datapoint">divorced</span> prompted a
      new inquiry result:
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong style="margin: 0; color: navajowhite;">TODO</strong> ...
          <br><br>
          <small style="color: silver;">Data points that have been read:</small>
          <span class="datapoint">change of marital status: married &rarr; divorced</span>
        </li>
      </ul>
