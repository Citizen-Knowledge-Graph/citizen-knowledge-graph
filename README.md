# OntoEngine

## Setup in IntelliJ IDEA

Use *Open* to navigate to the respective project-`pom.xml` and choose *Open as Project*. This will set it up correctly as Maven project, resolve the dependencies, detect the Spring Boot run configuration etc. Note that in the `onto-client-javafx` project, the correct run configuration is not the autodetected one though. Set one up to use the `main()`-method in `OntoClientJavafxApplication` instead.
